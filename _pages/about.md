Hey, I'm Zakey! I'm a fullstack engineer currently focusing on applied AI.
Recently I've been working with React/Typescript to build applications that
leverage LLMs, like [Ask Airy](https://askairy.com). 
I've also worked on building software for large enterprises with Java/Spring, AWS, Azure, and more. 

Other interests of mine include XC paragliding, bodybuilding, permaculture, keeping chickens, and my cat.
