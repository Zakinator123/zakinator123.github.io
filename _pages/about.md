Hi, I'm Zakey! I'm a fullstack engineer with extensive backend experience.
Recently I've been working with TypeScript/React to build applications that
leverage LLMs, like [Ask Airy](https://askairy.com). I've also worked on building software for large enterprises with Java/Spring, 
AWS, Azure, and more. 

Off the computer I have many interests. I have a large permaculture garden, chickens, a cat, and I'm an intermediate
paragliding pilot.
