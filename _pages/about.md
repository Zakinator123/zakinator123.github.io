Hi, I'm Zakey! I'm a fullstack engineer with broad experience. Recently I've been working with TypeScript/React to build LLM-centered
applications, like [Ask Airy](askairy.com). I've also worked extensively on building software with Java/Spring, 
AWS, Azure, and more. I have a deep interest in merging AI and user-facing software to drive serious value.

Off the computer I have many interests. I have a large permaculture garden, chickens, a cat, and I'm an intermediate
paragliding pilot.
